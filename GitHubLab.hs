1. Using a source code control system is helpful to manage development because it allows multiple people to work on the same thing and also allows a team or group of people to distribute a project and assign different parts to a specific individual. Also, having a source code control system gives the user a place to safely store their work.  

2. The "Watch" button allows you to follow a conversation and be notified when there are new messages. It also allows you to ignore certain conversations as well as give you the option to not be watching any conversations. 

   The star button allows you to favorite a reposirtory or a specific project.

   The fork button allows you to copy as repository and make test it as you please withiout modifying the original work. 

3. The README.md file contained my last name "Purcell" within it so if I had to guess what its meaning is I would say it would be to identify that the work submitted within that repository is mine.
